# python-challenge-
For this project I was provided with two data sets and was given instructions on how to create different scripts using Python in order to analyze different patterns and draw specific
conclusions regarding the financial analytics of a hypothetical company and the poll results and statistics from a a hypothetical election. The financial analysis consists of drawing the results 
from the number of months included in the analysis, the total profits/loses in the company, changes in profits/loses, and the greatest increases and decreases in profits/loses ver the 
time period of months previously designated. 
The analysis of the election results emphasizes how many votes were made, all of the candidates that recieved votes, the percentage and total number of votes that each candidate received, 
and who won the election on the basis of the popular votes.
